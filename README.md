# Supply Chain Analysis
Utilized Python for in-depth analysis of supply chain data to identify key insights and trends related to sales performance, defect rates, and lead times. Developed an end-to-end data pipeline, leveraging data collection, cleaning, and transformation techniques to ensure data accuracy and consistency. Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Pandas and visualized supply chain KPIs with Matplotlib and Seaborn to uncover patterns and correlations. Applied predictive modeling techniques to forecast demand and optimize inventory levels, resulting in improved cost-efficiency and reduced stockouts. Created dashboards to present actionable insights on sales trends, product defects, and lead time variability, enabling stakeholders to make data-driven decisions.
